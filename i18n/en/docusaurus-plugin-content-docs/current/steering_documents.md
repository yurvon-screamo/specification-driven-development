# 🎯 Guiding Documents

**Objective:** Ensure consistency, quality, and efficiency in development by creating and maintaining a set of living, atomic documents that serve as the project’s shared context and guide the team in implementing any work items—from micro-specifications to large features.

## Core Principles

Guiding documents are not static artifacts but dynamic knowledge management and quality assurance tools. Their creation and maintenance are governed by the following key principles:

1. **Atomicity and Focus:** Each document must focus on a single, specific topic (e.g., `git_workflow`, `react_component_structure`, `postgres_naming_conventions`). Avoid creating monolithic, all-encompassing manuals.
2. **Living Documentation:** Documents must be regularly updated as the project, technologies, and best practices evolve. Outdated documentation is worse than no documentation at all.
3. **Practical Orientation:** Content must be directly applicable by developers in their day-to-day work. Focus on the “how” and “why,” not abstract theories.
4. **Contextuality:** Documents may be global (applying to the entire solution) or local (specific to a particular module, microservice, or component). Clearly indicate the scope of applicability.
5. **Integration into Workflow:** Guiding documents are an integral part of the specification-driven development process. They must be explicitly referenced in design specifications and considered during task planning.
6. **Ownership of Currency:** It is recommended to create dedicated tasks within specifications for maintaining the currency of guiding documents, especially after significant changes to the codebase or infrastructure.

## Primary Categories of Guiding Documents

To ensure comprehensive coverage of the development lifecycle, guiding documents are grouped into the following categories:

### 1. Development Environment and Infrastructure Standards

* **Objective:** Ensure consistency and reproducibility of local and CI/CD environments.
* **Example Documents:**
  * `development_environment_setup`: Local setup procedures, dependencies, IDE configuration.
  * `environment_variables_management`: Rules for naming, storing, and managing environment variables.
  * `build_and_deployment_processes`: Build scripts, CI/CD pipeline configurations, deployment procedures across environments.
  * `infrastructure_as_code_standards`: Standards for Terraform, CloudFormation, etc.

### 2. Code Quality Guidelines

* **Objective:** Maintain high code quality, readability, and maintainability.
* **Example Documents:**
  * `language_style_guide_[language]`: Style guides (e.g., `python_style_guide`, `typescript_style_guide`).
  * `naming_conventions`: Conventions for naming variables, functions, classes, files, and database objects.
  * `code_organization_patterns`: Patterns for structuring projects, modules, and components.
  * `code_documentation_requirements`: Requirements for comments, docstrings, and documentation generation.

### 3. Git Workflow Standards

* **Objective:** Ensure a predictable and efficient collaborative source code management process.
* **Example Documents:**
  * `git_branching_strategy`: Branch naming conventions (e.g., `feature/`, `hotfix/`, `release/`).
  * `commit_message_format`: Commit message format (e.g., Conventional Commits).
  * `pull_request_process`: Procedures for creating, reviewing, and merging PRs (description requirements, checklists).
  * `code_review_guidelines`: Guidelines for reviewers and authors (what to check, how to provide feedback).

### 4. Technology- and Architecture-Specific Standards

* **Objective:** Establish unified design and implementation rules for the project’s key technologies.
* **Example Documents:**
  * `frontend_architecture_patterns`: UI development patterns (e.g., React/Vue component structure, state management).
  * `backend_api_design`: Standards for designing REST/gRPC APIs (versioning, response structure, error codes, OpenAPI/Swagger documentation).
  * `database_design_and_migration`: Rules for database schema design, migration conventions, and indexing strategies.
  * `testing_strategy_[level]`: Global testing strategies (e.g., `unit_testing_strategy`, `e2e_testing_strategy`, framework selection, coverage requirements).

### 5. Security, Performance, and Observability

* **Objective:** Lay the foundation for building reliable, secure, and easily diagnosable systems.
* **Example Documents:**
  * `security_practices`: Applied security practices (input validation, session management, secret handling, dependency scanning).
  * `performance_optimization_guidelines`: Optimization guidelines (caching, asynchronous processing, profiling).
  * `monitoring_and_alerting_standards`: Standards for logging, metrics, tracing, and alert configuration.

### 6. Business Context and Architecture

* **Objective:** Ensure shared understanding of the domain and the system’s high-level structure.
* **Example Documents (core documents, always create):**
  * `tech_stack`: Explicit justification for each technology in the stack, including versions.
  * `domain_glossary`: Glossary of key business terms and concepts.
  * `project_dataflow`: High-level description of data flows within the system.
  * `context_diagram_c4`: C4 context diagram (Level 1; likec4 syntax recommended).
  * `container_diagram_c4`: C4 container diagram (Level 2; likec4 syntax recommended).

## Step-by-Step Creation and Maintenance Process

### Step 1: Needs Assessment and Planning

* **Objective:** Determine which guiding document is needed and plan its creation.
* **Process:**
    1. **Project Analysis:** Review the current codebase to identify inconsistencies or areas where the absence of standards leads to errors.
    2. **Gap Identification:** Determine which standard category is missing or requires updating.
    3. **Prioritization:** Assess the potential impact of the document. Priority order: security > code quality > workflow > performance.
    4. **Template and Scope Selection:** Decide whether the document will be global or component-specific. Choose an appropriate level of detail (lightweight for small teams, comprehensive for enterprise solutions).
    5. **Task Creation:** Record the need to create or update the document as a distinct work item in the backlog.

### Step 2: Content Development

* **Objective:** Produce a practical, clear, and useful document.
* **Process:**
    1. **Research Best Practices:** Use industry standards (e.g., Google Style Guides, 12-factor app) as a foundation.
    2. **Project Contextualization:** Adapt general practices to the project’s specific technologies, constraints, and goals.
    3. **Include Examples:** Always provide concrete, working code samples, configuration files, or diagrams. “Show, don’t tell.”
    4. **Link Integration:** Connect the new document to other guiding documents and relevant sections of design specifications.
    5. **Formalization:** Use clear, unambiguous language. Avoid terms like “should” or “recommended” where “must” or “must not” can be used instead.

### Step 3: Validation and Approval

* **Objective:** Ensure the document is useful, actionable, and error-free.
* **Quality Criteria:**
  * **Actionability:** Can a developer immediately apply these rules in practice?
  * **Clarity:** Is the document understandable to a new team member?
  * **Consistency:** Does it contradict other guiding documents or approved design specifications?
  * **Completeness:** Does it cover all key aspects of the stated topic?
  * **Relevance:** Is it based on the current state of the project and technologies?
* **Process:** Conduct a document review with key developers and architects. Obtain formal approval from the technical lead.

### Step 4: Maintenance and Evolution

* **Objective:** Keep the document current throughout the project’s lifecycle.
* **Process:**
    1. **Regular Review:** Periodically verify the currency of all guiding documents.
    2. **Update upon Changes:** Any significant change to architecture, technology stack, or processes **must** be accompanied by updates to relevant guiding documents. This may be handled as a separate task within the corresponding specification.
    3. **Remove Obsolete Content:** Do not hesitate to delete documents or sections that are no longer relevant. Maintain “minimal sufficiency.”
