# 🎨 Design Phase Documentation

The design phase is a critically important stage in software development, transforming approved requirements into a detailed technical implementation plan. This document serves as the official guide for the entire team, providing a single point of reference for architects, developers, testers, and stakeholders.

**Key Value of the Design Phase**:

- Creates a "bridge" between business requirements and technical implementation  
- Identifies and resolves potential issues before coding begins  
- Ensures transparency and alignment in decision-making  
- Serves as the foundation for effort estimation and work planning  
- Reduces risks of misunderstandings and rework during implementation  

## Purpose and Objectives

Create a technically sound, implementable, and verifiable design that fully aligns with approved requirements and is ready to be broken down into implementation tasks.

**Requirements Transformation**  

- Translate functional requirements into architectural components  
- Convert non-functional requirements (performance, security) into technical solutions  

**Conduct Targeted Research**  

- Analyze technological options for critical components  
- Study best practices and design patterns  
- Assess risks and constraints of chosen solutions  

**Define System Structure**  

- Identify key modules and their interactions  
- Design interfaces between components  
- Develop data models and their transformations  

**Plan for Reliability**  

- Design error handling and recovery mechanisms  
- Define testing strategies across all levels  
- Ensure compliance with security requirements  

**Document Decisions**  

- Record all architectural decisions with justification  
- Establish traceability between requirements and design elements  
- Prepare materials for handover to developers

## Principles of Research Integration

**Defining the Research Scope**:

- **Focus on critical decisions**. Investigate only those aspects that directly impact architecture or involve high uncertainty. For example, choosing between synchronous and asynchronous payment processing requires in-depth analysis, whereas selecting a UI color scheme can rely on existing guidelines.  
- **Time-boxed efforts**. Set clear time limits for research activities.  
- **Actionable insights**. Collect and retain only information that directly influences decision-making.  

**Documenting Research**:

- **Contextual linkage**. Each finding must explicitly reference a specific requirement or problem.  
- **Source references**. Include direct links to documentation, articles, and code examples.  
- **Integration into design**. Do not store research in isolation. Embed key findings directly into relevant sections of the architectural document.  
- **Decision rationale**. For every decision made, specify:  
  - Alternatives considered  
  - Evaluation criteria  
  - Reasons for selecting the current option  
  - Potential trade-offs

## Common Design Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Over-Engineering

**Problem**: Designing for requirements that don't exist or adding functionality "for the future."

**Symptoms**:

- Design includes components with no direct link to current requirements  
- Complex abstractions for scenarios that may never materialize  
- Extended design timeline without clear benefit  

**Solution**:

- Focus strictly on current requirements  
- Apply the YAGNI principle (You Aren't Gonna Need It)  
- Design should be extensible but not implement unused features  
- Regularly ask: "Which specific requirement justifies this component?"

### Mistake 2: Poorly Specified Interfaces

**Problem**: Vague component boundaries and interactions leading to implementation misunderstandings.

**Symptoms**:

- Unclear component responsibilities  
- Missing clear API contracts  
- Numerous clarification questions during implementation  

**Solution**:

- Clearly define inputs, outputs, and errors for each interface  
- Use formal specifications (OpenAPI, Protobuf)  
- Include example requests and responses  
- Conduct interface reviews with developers before implementation  

### Mistake 3: Ignoring Non-Functional Requirements

**Problem**: Focusing only on functional behavior while neglecting performance, security, and other non-functional aspects.

**Symptoms**:

- No mention of response time, load capacity, or security  
- Missing scaling or failover strategies  
- Undefined quality metrics  

**Solution**:

- Explicitly document all non-functional requirements in a dedicated section  
- Specify measurable metrics for each (e.g., "Response time < 500ms at 1000 RPS")  
- Include design elements that ensure NFR compliance  
- Verify NFR compliance during final review  

### Mistake 4: Technology-Driven Design

**Problem**: Selecting technologies before fully understanding requirements, leading to suboptimal solutions.

**Symptoms**:

- Technologies mentioned before requirements are defined  
- Technology comparisons without specific task alignment  
- Unnecessary complexity from using "trendy" technologies  

**Solution**:

- Let requirements drive technology choices, not vice versa  
- For each technology, specify the exact requirement it satisfies  
- Consider simple solutions before complex ones  
- Use a technology evaluation matrix with requirement-based criteria  

### Mistake 5: Inadequate Error Handling Design

**Problem**: Designing only for the "happy path" while ignoring failure scenarios.

**Symptoms**:

- Missing error handling section  
- No recovery strategies for failures  
- Undefined user error messages  

**Solution**:

- Explicitly design error handling alongside main workflows  
- Define possible failure scenarios for each operation  
- Include retry mechanisms, fallback strategies, and monitoring in design  
- Ensure user experience is considered for all scenarios

## Resolving Design Issues

### Issue: Design Becomes Overly Complex

**Symptoms**:

- Design document exceeds 2500 lines without clear necessity  
- Too many components and interactions  
- Difficulty explaining architecture to new team members  

**Solution**:

- Return to requirements and remove elements without direct linkage  
- Consider phased implementation (MVP + subsequent iterations)  
- Refactor architecture by consolidating related components  

### Issue: Requirements Don't Map to Design

**Symptoms**:

- Difficulty tracing requirements to design elements  
- Some requirements missing from design  
- No clear connection between business goals and technical decisions  

**Solution**:

- Create a requirements-to-design traceability matrix  
- Conduct step-by-step verification of each requirement  
- Add requirement references to relevant design sections  

### Issue: Technology Choices Are Unclear

**Symptoms**:

- Multiple viable options without clear selection criteria  
- Missing justification for chosen technologies  

**Solution**:

- Define decision criteria based on requirements and constraints  
- Create a comparison matrix with key criteria evaluation  
- Conduct proof-of-concept for critical decisions  
- Document selection rationale including trade-offs  

### Issue: Design Lacks Implementation Details

**Symptoms**:

- Many questions during implementation  
- Ambiguity in interfaces and contracts  

**Solution**:

- Add specific example requests and responses  
- Clarify data formats and error codes  
- Include sequence diagrams for key scenarios

## Conclusion

A design document is not merely a formal artifact but a living tool that ensures successful project implementation. High-quality design:

- Reduces errors and rework  
- Accelerates development through clear guidance  
- Simplifies knowledge transfer among team members  
- Serves as the foundation for implementation quality assessment  

**Key Principles of Effective Design**:

1. **Minimal sufficiency** — design exactly what's needed for implementation  
2. **Practical orientation** — focus on solutions ready for implementation  
3. **Decision transparency** — every decision must have clear justification  
4. **Living document** — regularly update design as new information emerges
