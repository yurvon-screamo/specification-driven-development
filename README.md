# Specification Driven Development

A **unified, structured approach to software development** that ensures quality, maintainability, and business requirement compliance.

## ðŸš€ Specification-driven development

This methodology guarantees that every new feature or change starts not with code, but with a clear understanding of *what*, *why*, and *how*.

The methodology consists of three key phases:

1. **Requirements Phase** â€” transforming ideas into clear, testable conditions
2. **Design Phase** â€” creating detailed technical implementation plans  
3. **Tasks Phase** â€” breaking down design into specific, actionable steps for developers

Additionally, the methodology includes the concept of **steering documents** â€” living project standards (such as Git conventions, code style, architecture) that serve as common context for all specifications.

For smaller tasks, **lightweight specifications** (micro and quick) are provided to avoid bureaucracy while maintaining the essence of the approach.

The main goal is to create **quality, maintainable, and business-needed** software **efficiently** with **minimal risks**.
