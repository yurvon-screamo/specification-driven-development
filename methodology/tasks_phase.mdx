# ✅ Task Phase Documentation

The task phase is the final phase of the specification-driven development process, transforming an approved design into a structured implementation plan composed of discrete, executable development tasks. This phase serves as a bridge between planning and execution, breaking down complex system designs into manageable steps that can be incrementally carried out by development teams or AI agents.

As the third phase in the Requirements → Design → Tasks workflow, the task phase ensures that all meticulous planning and design efforts translate into systematic, trackable implementation progress.

## Purpose and Objectives

The task phase serves to:

- Transform design components into concrete development activities  
- Sequence tasks for optimal development flow and early validation  
- Create clear, actionable prompts for implementation  
- Establish dependencies and build order among tasks  
- Ensure incremental progress with testable milestones  
- Provide a roadmap for systematic feature development  

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Design Analysis and Task Identification

**Objective**: Break down the design into implementable components

**Task List Formation Principles**:

1. **Review Design Components**: Identify all system components that need to be built or modified  
2. **Map to Code Artifacts**: Determine which files, classes, and functions must be created or altered  
3. **Account for Testing Requirements**: Plan test creation alongside implementation  
4. **Sequence for Early Validation**: Order tasks to enable rapid validation of core functionality  
5. **Link to Requirements**: Reference specific requirements being implemented, ensuring traceability from task to user value  

**Task Creation Principles**:

- Focus on concrete activities (writing, modifying, testing code)  
- Each task must produce working, testable code  
- Tasks must build incrementally upon previous work  

### Step 2: Task Structuring and Hierarchy

**Objective**: Decompose tasks into subtasks

**Task Organization Principles**:

1. **Maximum Two Levels**: Use only top-level tasks and subtasks (avoid deeper nesting)  
2. **Logical Grouping**: Group related tasks under meaningful categories  
3. **Sequential Dependencies**: Order tasks so each builds upon prior work  
4. **Testable Increments**: Each task must result in testable functionality  

**Task Execution Sequencing Principles**:

- **Core First**: Build core functionality before optional features  
- **Risk First**: Address uncertain or complex tasks early  
- **Value First**: Implement high-value features that can be quickly tested  
- **Dependency-Driven**: Respect technical dependencies between components  
- **Foundation First**: Implement core interfaces and data models before dependent components  
- **Bottom-Up Approach**: Develop low-level utilities before high-level functions  
- **Test-Driven Sequencing**: Write tests alongside or before implementation  
- **Integration Points**: Plan component integration as components are built

```

### Step 3: Task Definition and Specification

**Objective**: Enrich subtask details with the following information:

1. **Clear Objective**: Specify exactly which code needs to be written or modified  
2. **Implementation Details**: Identify specific files, components, or functions to create  
3. **Requirements Traceability**: Reference specific requirements being implemented  
4. **Design Traceability**: Reference the design being implemented  
5. **Acceptance Criteria**: Define how to verify task completion  
6. **Testing Expectations**: Specify which tests must be written or updated  

### Step 4: Validation and Refinement

**Task Quality Criteria**:

1. **Actionable**: Can be executed without requiring further clarification  
2. **Specific**: Clearly state which files, functions, or components to create  
3. **Testable**: Produce code that can be tested and validated  
4. **Incremental**: Build upon previous tasks without large complexity jumps  
5. **Complete**: Cover all aspects of the design requiring implementation  

**Validation Questions**:

- Can a developer begin implementation based solely on this task description?  
- Does this task produce working, testable code?  
- Are the requirements being implemented clearly identified?  
- Does this task logically build upon previous tasks?  
- Is the task scope appropriate (not too large, not too small)?  

#### Quality Checklist

Before finalizing the task list, verify:

**Completeness**:

- [ ] All design components are covered by implementation tasks  
- [ ] All requirements are addressed by one or more tasks  
- [ ] Testing tasks are included for all core functionality  
- [ ] Integration tasks connect all components  

**Clarity**:

- [ ] Each task has a clear, specific objective  
- [ ] Task descriptions specify which files/components to create  
- [ ] Requirement references are included for every task  
- [ ] Completion criteria are explicit or implicitly clear  

**Sequencing**:

- [ ] Tasks are ordered to respect dependencies  
- [ ] Early tasks establish foundations for subsequent work  
- [ ] Core functionality is implemented before optional features  
- [ ] Integration tasks follow component implementation  

**Implementability**:

- [ ] Each task is appropriately sized for implementation  
- [ ] No tasks require external dependencies or manual processes  
- [ ] Task complexity increases gradually  

## Addressing Task Planning Issues

### Issue: Tasks Are Too Vague

**Symptoms**: Developers cannot start implementation from task descriptions  
**Solution**: Add more specific implementation details, including file/component names  

### Issue: Task Dependencies Are Unclear

**Symptoms**: Tasks cannot be completed due to missing prerequisites  
**Solution**: Review task sequence and add missing foundational tasks  

### Issue: Task-to-Requirement Linkage Is Unclear

**Symptoms**: Difficulty tracing tasks back to user value  
**Solution**: Add requirement references and validate coverage
