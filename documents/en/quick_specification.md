# üöÄ Quick Specification Documentation

A Quick Specification is a document that provides development teams with a structured yet lightweight process for specifying small features, ensuring clarity, testability, and traceability while minimizing bureaucracy and excessive documentation.

**Purpose and Objectives of the "Quick Specification":**

* Transform an idea for a small feature into clear, testable acceptance criteria.
* Create a direct and understandable implementation plan in the form of a task list.
* Establish shared understanding among developers, testers, and product managers.
* Ensure traceability from user value down to specific coding tasks.
* Reduce cognitive load on developers by enabling them to focus on one task at a time.

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Formulate the User Story and Acceptance Criteria (EARS)

**Objective:** Define *what* needs to be done and *why*, establishing measurable success criteria.

**Write the user story:** Use the format "As a [role], I want [feature] so that [benefit]." Focus on business value.

**Create acceptance criteria using the EARS format:** Convert the story into 3‚Äì7 specific, unambiguous, and testable statements.

* Use templates: `WHEN... THEN...`, `IF... THEN...`, `WHEN... AND... THEN...`, `WHEN... (error) THEN...`.
* **Mandatory:** Include at least one error-handling or edge-case scenario.
* Avoid implementation details (e.g., "use Redis").
* Avoid vague terms ("fast," "convenient").
* Each requirement must start with `WHEN` or `IF` and contain `THEN the system SHALL`.

**Outcome:** A clearly defined scope of work with measurable completion criteria.

### Step 2: Convert Requirements into Implementation Tasks

**Objective:** Break down acceptance criteria into concrete, actionable steps for developers.

**Analyze each acceptance criterion:** Identify the exact coding actions required to fulfill it.

**Formulate tasks:** Each task should describe a specific activity (e.g., "Create endpoint `/api/v1/user/status`," "Add `last_login` field to the `User` model," "Write a unit test for email validation").

**Establish sequence:** Tasks should be logically ordered‚Äîtypically starting with foundational elements (data models, API contracts), followed by business logic, then error handling and tests.

**Ensure traceability:** Each task must explicitly reference the acceptance criterion it implements (e.g., "Implements Criterion 3: WHEN the user submits the form...").

**Outcome:** A structured, ready-to-execute task list.

### Step 3: Validation and Refinement

**Objective:** Ensure the specification is complete, clear, and implementable.

**Self-check using the checklist below:**

* The user story clearly defines the role, action, and value.
* All acceptance criteria are written in EARS format.
* Error-handling or edge-case criteria are included (minimum of one).
* Each implementation task has a clear, specific objective.
* Each task references its corresponding acceptance criterion.
* Tasks are ordered in a logical sequence.
* The specification enables the developer to begin implementation immediately.

**Outcome:** An approved, implementation-ready specification.

### Document Template

```md
# Quick Specification: "[Concise and clear feature/change title]"

**User Story:**

As a [user role], I want [feature/change description] so that [business value/benefit].

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### **[Name/Description of Criterion 1]**

WHEN [event] THEN the system SHALL [observable outcome].

### **[Name/Description of Criterion 2]**

IF [condition] THEN the system SHALL [observable outcome].

### **[Name/Description of Criterion 3 ‚Äì ERROR HANDLING/EDGE CASE REQUIRED]**

WHEN [exceptional event] THEN the system SHALL [error-handling action].

### *[Add 1‚Äì4 more criteria if needed]*

## Implementation Plan

*Tasks are ordered according to implementation logic. Each task references the acceptance criterion it fulfills.*

### [Specific action, e.g., "Create API endpoint /api/v1/feature"]

  * *Implements criteria:* [Reference to criteria]
  * *Details:* [Which files/components to create/modify? Brief logic description.]
  * *Completion criterion:* [e.g., "Code written; API contract documented in Swagger."]

### [Specific action, e.g., "Add input data validation"]
  * *Implements criteria:* [Reference to criteria]
  * *Details:* [Which files/components to create/modify? Brief logic description.]
  * *Completion criterion:* [e.g., "Validation implemented; unit tests for validation pass."]

### [Specific action, e.g., "Write integration test"]
  * *Implements criteria:* [Reference to criteria]
  * *Details:* [Which files/components to create/modify? Brief logic description.]
  * *Completion criterion:* [e.g., "Test written and passes successfully."]

### [Specific action, e.g., "Update user documentation"]
  * *Implements criteria:* [Reference to criteria]
  * *Details:* [Which files/components to create/modify? Brief logic description.]
  * *Completion criterion:* [e.g., "User Guide section updated and published to the website."]
